# Consenrich

Consenrich is regularized linear state estimator that yields quantitative genome-wide signal tracks from multi-sample cohorts' epigenomic HTS data.

Emphasis is placed on computational efficiency, model interpretability, and practical utility for downstream tasks that require well-resolved genome-wide signal estimates with uncertainty moderation, such as:

* Consensus detection of open chromatin regions, TF binding, histone modification, etc.
* Candidate prioritization for differential analyses, functional validation, integrative modeling, etc.

[**See the Documentation**](https://nolan-h-hamilton.github.io/Consenrich/) for usage examples, installation details, configuration options, and an API reference.
