*Consenrich* estimates genome-wide regulatory signal hidden in noisy, multi-sample HTS datasets.

Consenrich explicitly models critical but often-overlooked aspects in genomic signal quantification:

- *Sample-specific and region-specific noise* across the genome, addressing both technical and biological sources that corrupt sequencing data.
- *Dependencies between proximal loci* for spatially consistent, recursive propagation of signals and uncertainty genome-wide.

These refinements grant immediate practical appeal to a wide array of downstream tasks requiring quantitative, uncertainty-calibrated analysis of shared regulatory signals.
